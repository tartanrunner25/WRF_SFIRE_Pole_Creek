! A limited version from 2010 is included in WRF release. We no longer 
! support that version.

! This module is the only entry point from WRF-ARW to the wildland 
! fire model. The call to sfire_driver advances the fire model by 
! one timestep. The fire model inputs the wind and outputs 
! temperature and humidity tendencies. The fire model also inputs a 
! number of constant arrays (fuel data, topography). Additional 
! arguments are model state (for data assimilation) and constant arrays 
! the model gives to WRF for safekeeping because it is not allowed 
! to save anything.

! This code as of mid-2011 is described in [1]. If you use this code, 
! please acknowledge our work by citing [1].
! Thank you.

! The fire physics code is adapted from the CAWFE code [2].
! The coupling with WRF is adapted from a code by Ned Patton, 
! coupling a Fortran 90 port of the CAWFE fire module to WRF [3].
! Support of refined fire grids in WRF was provided by John Michalakes.
! Jonathan D. Beezley has set up and maintained the WRF build and
! execution environment, provided software engineering infrastructure 
! including synchronization with the WRF repository, and was responsibe
! for all aspects of WRF modification. UCD students Minjeong Kim and
! Volodymyr Kondratenko have contributed to the implementation of the
! fire propagation by the level set method.
